			<p>Donald Trump's Secretary of Education nominations concluded with a historic vote: Vice President Mike Pence broke a tie in the Senate to appoint Betsy DeVos. The appointment had been a huge whirlwind of controversy, with constituents calling in record numbers to express their displeasure in DeVos' lack of experience, donations to politicians, and stances on a number of education issues. Even without this context, the media narrative for the last few years proclaimed that the Republican Party did not care for public education. </p>

			<p>This is probably more or less accurate, to the extent that it applies to funding higher education. However, this should actually be surprising, because more Republican senators attended public universities for their Bachelors Degrees than did Democrats, as a percentage of their respective groups. </p>
